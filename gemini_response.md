**Summary**

The document outlines the requirements for an Enterprise Solution Development project for the IS213 course. The goal is to design and implement an enterprise solution using a microservices architecture.

**Key Requirements**

* Design and implement a microservices solution for a business scenario
* Use appropriate technologies and tools
* Implement at least 3 user scenarios
* Leverage REST and AMQP communication
* Use Docker and Docker Compose
* Demonstrate Beyond-The-Labs (BTL) implementations
* Submit a proposal, presentation, report, and executables
* Undergo intra- and inter-team peer evaluations

**Project Ideas**

1. **Taxi Booking System:** Develop a taxi booking system with user scenarios such as booking a ride, tracking the taxi, and managing payments. Implement microservices for passenger, driver, and booking management. Use REST and AMQP for communication.
2. **Food Delivery Platform:** Create a food delivery platform with user scenarios for ordering food, tracking delivery, and managing customer accounts. Design microservices for restaurant, customer, and order management. Utilize RabbitMQ for asynchronous order processing.
3. **E-Commerce Marketplace:** Implement an e-commerce marketplace with user scenarios for browsing products, adding items to cart, and completing purchases. Create microservices for product catalog, shopping cart, and order fulfillment. Use Docker Compose for deployment.
4. **ERP System:** Develop an ERP system with user scenarios for managing invoices, processing orders, and tracking inventory. Implement microservices for accounting, sales, and inventory management. Use Beyond-The-Labs technologies such as GraphQL for API queries.
5. **Logistics Management System:** Create a logistics management system with user scenarios for tracking shipments, managing warehouses, and optimizing delivery routes. Design microservices for shipment tracking, warehouse management, and route optimization. Utilize external services for real-time GPS tracking.
