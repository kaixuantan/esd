## Summary

The document outlines the requirements for an administrative system that will have the following features:

- Applications & Proxy Design
- Authentication
- Access Control
- Logging
- Maker-Checker (Bonus)

The system will be used by the employees of the company to assist customers, manage configurations, and provide support to other departments. The system will need to maintain a set of user roles, permissions, and setup guards to prevent unauthorized use.

## Key Requirements

- The system should be able to connect and communicate with multiple backend systems in a secure manner.
- The system should be able to authenticate users and check for the user's role.
- The system should be able to log critical user actions.
- The system should be able to implement the Maker-Checker workflow.
- The system should be resilient against downtime and data loss.
- The system should be able to scale to support high volumes of traffic.
- The system should be able to support the growth of the user base.
- The system should be secure against data breaches.
- The system should be easy to maintain and deploy.
- The system should be designed in such a way that there are no single points of failure.

## Ideas to Fulfill the Requirements

- **Applications & Proxy Design:**
  - Use a microservices architecture to connect to multiple backend systems.
  - Implement an API gateway to provide a single entry point for all API calls.
- **Authentication:**
  - Use OAuth 2.0 to authenticate users.
  - Implement a role-based access control system.
- **Access Control:**
  - Use a role-based access control system to grant users access to different features.
  - Implement a Maker-Checker workflow for critical actions.
- **Logging:**
  - Use a centralized logging service to log critical user actions.
  - Filter personal information from logs.
- **Maker-Checker:**
  - Implement a Maker-Checker workflow for critical actions.
  - Send notifications to checkers when a transaction is pending approval.
- **Resilience:**
  - Deploy the system in multiple availability zones.
  - Implement a disaster recovery plan.
- **Scalability:**
  - Use a distributed architecture to scale the system horizontally.
  - Implement load balancing to distribute traffic across multiple servers.
- **Growth:**
  - Provision the system to support the growth of the user base.
  - Implement a data partitioning strategy to improve performance.
- **Security:**
  - Encrypt all sensitive data.
  - Implement a firewall to protect the system from unauthorized access.
  - Implement a security monitoring system to detect and respond to security threats.
- **Ease of Maintenance and Deployment:**
  - Use a continuous integration and continuous delivery pipeline to automate the deployment process.
  - Implement a health check system to monitor the system's health.
